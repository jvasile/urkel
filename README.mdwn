# Factoid module for Sopel

Sopel has a factoid module called Bucket, but apparently the code is
disfavored.  Moreover, it implements a bot that seems designed for all
kinds of silliness and not just serving up factoids.  While I have
nothing against silliness, I'd really like a clean factoid bot that
just does that one thing.

## Grammar

We're taking cues from
[infobot](http://www.infobot.org/guide-0.43.x.html) on grammar.

Set factoids: Abierto will respond to "X is Y" and "X are Y".

Access factoids: "What is X?", "Where is X?", or "X?"  If there are
too many answers, it will send privmsg.  If there's just a giant pile
of them, it will tell you that.

Alter factoids: Address the bot and use "Abierto: X =~ s/A/B/" and
that will change all instances of A to B in the factoid.

Append: "X is also Y" will add an answer to X's list of factoids.

Delete factoid: "Abierto: forget X"

Replace factoid: "Abierto: no, X is Y"  will replace the factoid with Y.
